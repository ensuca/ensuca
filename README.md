## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I am Enes, I am a senior student in Computer Engineering at Ondokuz MayÄ±s University and I base my talents on technology and data analytics. I completed my internship as a Big Data Engineer at Bentego and increased my practical experience in the sector during this process.

I also worked on various freelance projects and shared these systems on my GitHub profile with the permission of the project owners. You can see the works i done from my github

I am a permanent candidate in the world of technology and it is exciting for me to follow the innovations in the industry. I think I stand out with my ability to adapt to flexible working hours and my ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment.
